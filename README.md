This project was developed as part of the 18.337 class project.

## Introduction
This project leverages the Julia scientific machine learning ecosystem to establish a robust, high-performance simulation platform for the Cahn-Hilliard phase field model, a method used in studying phase-separating electrode materials. The work addresses common numerical challenges associated with simulating the stiff, nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard partial differential equation in custom geometries.

## Background
The Cahn-Hilliard model is a powerful tool for simulating dynamics in lithium ion battery materials. However, this model presents numerous numerical challenges due to its complexity. By leveraging Julia's high-performance scientific computing suite, this project provides a robust and efficient solution for these challenges.

## Features
- High-performance simulations of the Cahn-Hilliard phase field model
- Support for GPU parallelization
- Applications to PDE-constrained optimization
